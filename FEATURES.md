# ✨ PersonaForge Features

PersonaForge is a dynamic simulator that allows you to model and observe the evolution of a personality profile through various life scenarios.

## Core Simulation

* **👤 Dynamic Profile Creation:** Define a unique personality by selecting a core trait, value, stressor, coping style, and preferred environment.
* **🔁 Scenario-Based Evolution:** Run the profile through a series of life scenarios like "Career Challenge" or "Personal Crisis" to see how it adapts.
* **📈 Core Metrics Tracking:** Quantify the journey with two primary metrics: `Adversity` and `Growth`. Watch them change in real-time based on events.
* **🌱 Trait & Value Evolution:** Witness the personality's core trait and value shift in response to significant life events, reflecting personal development.

## Visualization & Logging

* **📜 Real-Time Evolution Log:** A detailed log tracks every scenario, decision, and evolutionary change, providing a narrative of the personality's history.
* **🧬 Interactive Lifeline:** A unique SVG visualization plots the personality's journey, showing key milestones, evolutionary forks (trait/value changes), and metric progression over time.
* **📊 Progress Bars:** Instantly see the current levels of Adversity and Growth with dynamically updated progress bars.
* **🤖 Auto-Evolution Mode:** Set the simulation to run automatically, generating a continuous series of random life events to accelerate the personality's evolution.
