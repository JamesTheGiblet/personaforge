# ðŸ“œ The Data Manifesto: The Ephemeral Self

This project adheres to a simple, powerful, and liberating principle regarding data:

**There is no database.**

1. **Zero Persistence:** Every simulation, every personality, every evolutionary journey is ephemeral. It exists only in the memory of your browser tab for the duration of your session. When you close the tab, the self is gone.

2. **Absolute Privacy:** Since no data is ever sent to a server or stored permanently, your creations and simulations are yours and yours alone. There is nothing to track, collect, or compromise.

3. **Ultimate Simplicity:** The simulation runs entirely in the browser. There are no backend services, no database connections, and no external dependencies. This ensures portability, ease of use, and a focus on the simulation logic itself.

We believe this approach aligns with the project's theme: personality is not a static record in a database but a fluid, ever-changing process. Each session is a new life, a clean slate, a fresh opportunity for evolution.
