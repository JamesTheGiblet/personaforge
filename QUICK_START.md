# ðŸš€ Quick Start: PersonaForge

PersonaForge is a zero-dependency, browser-based simulation. No installation or build process is required.

## How to Run

1. **Get the code:** Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. **Open the file:** Navigate to the project directory and open the `personaforge.html` file in a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

## How to Use the Simulator

1. **Create a Profile:** Use the dropdown menus to select a `Core Trait`, `Core Value`, `Main Stressor`, `Coping Style`, and `Preferred Environment`. Click **Create Profile**.
2. **Run a Scenario:** Once your profile is created, click one of the scenario buttons (e.g., "Career Challenge") to see how your personality responds.
3. **Observe the Evolution:**
    * Check the **Personality Evolution Log** to see a text-based history of events.
    * Watch the **Lifeline** visualization grow with each new event.
4. **Auto-Evolve:** Click **Start Auto-Evolution** to have the simulator automatically run random scenarios over time.
